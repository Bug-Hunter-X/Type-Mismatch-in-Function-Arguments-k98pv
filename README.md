# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: type mismatches in function arguments. The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to pass a String argument to a function expecting a Double, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected code.
